Controllers are for representing the endpoints of the api

Models are the data types, they are broken into three separate tiers:

- App(lication): these types are for supporting the application itself 
- Domain: these types are for specific business logic concerns 
- Infra(structure): these types are used when the application communicates with outside interfaces
